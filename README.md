This project is to create a Tic-Tac-Toe game for a user to play in a browser. Here, were are focusing on factory functions as well as the Module Pattern. To further extend my learning with this project, I'll be writing the program to be able to play against AI.

Primary learning objectives include: 
 - Understanding when to use a factory function versus a module. 
 - Attempting to have as little global code as possible.
 - Utilizing private and public scopes.
 - Think carefully about where each bit of logic should reside (organization).
 - Further enhance understanding of ways to organize a programs code and understand some organizational patterns. 


Review:

Once I reached about 75% into the project, I was further understanding the importance of using modules and factories as a means to organize code. I could certaintly refactor this project for better organization. I'd like to revisit this project to add more then just an "easy" difficulty section to the player versus AI aspect of the project.
